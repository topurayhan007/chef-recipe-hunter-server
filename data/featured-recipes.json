      "4 chicken breasts",
      "1/2 cup all-purpose flour",
      "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder",
      "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano",
      "1/4 teaspoon salt",
      "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",
      "2 eggs",
      "1 cup Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs",
      "1 cup tomato sauce",
      "1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese",
      "1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese",
      "2 tablespoons olive oil"
    ],
    "cooking_method": "Preheat the oven to 190Â°C. Pound the chicken breasts until they are even in thickness. In a shallow dish, mix together the flour, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and pepper. In another shallow dish, whisk the eggs. In a third shallow dish, place the breadcrumbs. Dip each chicken breast first in the flour mixture, shaking off the excess, then in the egg mixture, and finally in the breadcrumbs. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from heat. Spread the tomato sauce over the chicken, then sprinkle with the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let cool slightly before serving.",
